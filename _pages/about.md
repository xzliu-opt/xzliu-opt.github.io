- I received my B.S. degree in [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://math.nwpu.edu.cn/) from [Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/), Xi’an, China, in 2022, where I was advised by Prof. [Jianchao Bai](https://www.scholat.com/bjc1987).
- Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. degree in the [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.buaa.edu.cn/) and the [Shen Yuan Honors College](https://hc.buaa.edu.cn/) at [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Yong Xia](https://math.buaa.edu.cn/szdw1/azcck/js/xy.htm).
- I am also a visiting Ph.D. student at [INMA/ICTEAM, UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam/inma), Belgium, supported by the [China Scholarship Council (CSC)](https://www.chinesescholarshipcouncil.com/), for a one-year research visit (Oct. 2025 – Oct. 2026), advised by Prof. [Geovani N. Grapiglia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=pt-BR&user=PwH5lDEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
